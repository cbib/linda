The image consists of a pattern of spots of light which correspond to individual atoms on the specimen surface. When a sudden voltage pulse is applied to the tip, atoms from the surface of the specimen itself are be ejected and travel down a drift tube where their arrival time (a measure of the mass of the atom) can be determined. This allows the atomic composition of the specimen to be determined." [rsc:hjb]

Defects arising from impurities, grain boundaries, interfaces, etc. result in the creation of traps that capture free electrons and holes. By monitoring the average capacitance produced by applying a voltage pulse to the semiconductor junction at a fixed temperatures, spectra are generated which exhibit a peak for each 'deep level' (each energy level near the center of the band gap). The height of the peak is proportional to the defect density and the emission rate is characteristic for each type of defect." [DOI:10.1063/1.357126]

The beam of electrons is scattered or diffracted at high angles before reaching the specimen, and the image results from a weakening of the beam by its interaction with the sample. An annular aperture is used to select electrons that have passed through given symmetric zones within the objective lens of the microscope. The electron beam is focused using a set of magnetic lenses which removes spherical aberration (an effect where the electron beam is deflected too strongly, resulting in a blurred image)."
