comment: Two lists of examples of parent material and rock are given. The reliability of the geological information and the knowledge of the local lithology will determine whether a general or a specific definition of the parent material can be given. Saprolite is used if the in situ weathered material is thoroughly decomposed, clay-rich but still showing rock structure. Alluvial deposits and colluvium derived from a single rock type may be further specified by that rock type.

name: Soil matrix color
comment: The color of the soil matrix material in the root zone around the accession is recorded in the moist condition (or both dry and moist condition, if possible) using the notations for hue, value and chroma as given in the Munsell Soil Color Charts (Munsell Color 1975). If there is no dominant soil matrix colour, the horizon is described as mottled and two or more colors are given and should be registered under uniform conditions. Early morning and late evening readings are not accurate. Provide depth of measurement [cm]. If a color chart is not available, states may be used.

name: Partially balanced design
comment: Partially balanced designs are less suitable than balanced designs as the statistical analysis is more complicated. When the variation among blocks (or rows and columns) is large, some pairs of treatments are more precisely compared than others, and several different standard errors may have to be computed for tests of significance. These difficulties increase as the design departs more and more from the symmetry of the balanced design.
