        <h3>Project description</h3>
        <p style="font-size: 12pt">In order to allow biologists to store and store the environmental metadata associated with plant phenotyping experiments and to facilitate a standardized exchange of information, the LINDA Web interface allows the user to insert his metadata according to the MIAPPE model and related ontologies (Plant ontology, XEO, ENVo, etc.).
            Exporting to the ISA-tab format will allow subsequent interconnection with the FAIRDOM suite so that all metadata can be linked to existing experiments.
            The ontologies present in the MIAPPE model are integrated in order to describe the metadata associated with the experiment.
