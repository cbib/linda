<h2>Experimental Factors</h2>
<p>
    The object of a study is to ascertain the impact of one or more factors on the biological material. Thus, a factor is, by definition a condition that varies between observation units, which may be biotic (pest, disease interaction) or abiotic (treatment and cultural practice) in nature. Depending on the level of the data, an experimental factor can be either  "what is the factor applied to the plant" (i.e. Unwatered), or the "environmental characterisation" (i.e. if no rain on unwatered plant : Drought ;  if rain on unwatered plant: Irrigated)
