    Linda uses the MIAPPE model to structure the information. The figure below represents the MIAPPE diagram with each of the elements composing it. Each component of the MIAPPE model contains several fields helping to describe your whole investigation

<h2>Observed variable</h2>
  <p>An observed variable describes how a measurement has been made. It typically takes the form of a measured characteristic of the observation unit (plant or environmental trait), associated to the method and unit of measurement.</p>
