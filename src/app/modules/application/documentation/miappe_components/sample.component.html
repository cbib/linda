    Linda uses the MIAPPE model to structure the information. The figure below represents the MIAPPE diagram with each of the elements composing it. Each component of the MIAPPE model contains several fields helping to describe your whole investigation

<h2>Sample</h2>
  <p>A sample is a portion of plant tissue extracted from an observation unit for the purpose of sub-plant observations and/or molecular studies. A sample must be used when there is a physical sample that needs to be stored and traced. Otherwise, you can use directly variables on the Observation unit (Berry sugar content, Fruit weight, Grain Protein content). (0+ per observation unit)</p>
