<h2>MIAPPE: Minimum Information About a Plant Phenotyping Experiment</h2>
<p>
    Linda uses the MIAPPE model to structure the information. 
    MIAPPE is an open, community driven project to harmonize data from plant phenotyping experiments. 
    MIAPPE comprises a conceptual checklist of metadata required to adequately describe a plant phenotyping experiment.
    The figure below represents the MIAPPE diagram with each of the elements composing it. 
    Each component of the MIAPPE model contains several fields helping to describe your whole investigation

<h2>Investigation</h2>
  <p>Investigations are research programmes with defined aims.They can exist at various scales (for example, they could encompass a grant-funded programme of work, the various components comprising a peer-reviewed publication, or a single experiment).			1 per MIAPPE submission</p>
