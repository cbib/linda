Investigation unique ID	
  Identifier comprising the unique name of the institution/database hosting the submission of the investigation data, and the accession number of the investigation in that institution.	EBI:12345678	Unique identifier	0-1
Investigation title	
  Human-readable string summarising the investigation.	Adaptation of Maize to Temperate Climates: Mid-Density Genome-Wide Association Genetics and Diversity Patterns Reveal Key Genomic Regions, with a Major Contribution of the Vgt2 (ZCN8) Locus.	Free text (short)	1
Investigation description	
  Human-readable text describing the investigation in more detail.	The migration of maize from tropical to temperate climates was accompanied by a dramatic evolution in flowering time. To gain insight into the genetic architecture of this adaptive trait, we conducted a 50K SNP-based genome-wide association and diversity investigation on a panel of tropical and temperate American and European representatives.
